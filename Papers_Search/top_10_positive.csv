"1","10.2151/jmsj.2011-104","A Numerical Investigation of Changes in Energy and Carbon Cycle Balances under Vegetation Transition due to Deforestation in the Asian Tropical Region","Temporal progress of forest reduction by deforestation in the Asian tropical region was simulated using a global climate model that included a new land-surface ecosystem model. The horizontal resolution of the model was 1.875. Two experimental areas were defined: the Indochina peninsula (ICP) area, and the Maritime Continent (MTC) area. With a control simulation under the actual vegetation condition, a grassland experiment (C4 experiment) and a bare-soil experiment (BS experiment) were carried out. Forest vegetation in the experimental areas was gradually changed (at the latest actual rate) to non-forest type vegetation. The natural growth of C4 grass was reproduced in the C4 experiment, and the plant growth was deterred in the BS experiment. Each experiment was run for 100 model years. Temporal changes of the energy and the carbon cycle balances under the vegetation transition were examined. Compared with the control, the net radiation (RNE) decreased because of the increase in the land surface albedo. The sensible heat flux decreased because of the decreases in RNE and other particular reasons. The results for latent heat flux (E) in this study differed from those in our previous study. In the C4 experiment, E increased, especially in the ICP area; in the BS experiment, E decreased in both experimental areas. In the MTC area, the surface temperature in the C4 experiment increased because of the large influence of decreased precipitation. Decreases of the soil wetness in the C4 experiment were more significant in the MTC area, due to increased transpiration and the decreased precipitation. The change from forest vegetation to C4 grass vegetation induced the reduction of carbon absorption by the land surface. Continuous deforestation in the Asian tropical region certainly induces the elevations of the global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, even if the deforested area is not replaced by bare soil surface condition.",14,0,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14,0,14,NA,NA
"2","10.1002/ece3.2729","Methods to test the interactive effects of drought and plant invasion on ecosystem structure and function using complementary common garden and field experiments","Abiotic global change drivers affect ecosystem structure and function, but how they interact with biotic factors such as invasive plants is understudied. Such interactions may be additive, synergistic, or offsetting, and difficult to predict. We present methods to test the individual and interactive effects of drought and plant invasion on native ecosystems. We coupled a factorial common garden experiment containing resident communities exposed to drought (imposed with rainout shelters) and invasion with a field experiment where the invader was removed from sites spanning a natural soil moisture gradient. We detail treatments and their effects on abiotic conditions, including soil moisture, light, temperature, and humidity, which shape community and ecosystem responses. Ambient precipitation during the garden experiment exceeded historic norms despite severe drought in prior years. Soil moisture was 48% lower in drought than ambient plots, but the invader largely offset drought effects. Additionally, temperature and light were lower and humidity higher in invaded plots. Field sites spanned up to a 10-fold range in soil moisture and up to a 2.5-fold range in light availability. Invaded and resident vegetation did not differentially mediate soil moisture, unlike in the garden experiment. Herbicide effectively removed invaded and resident vegetation, with removal having site-specific effects on soil moisture and light availability. However, light was generally higher in invader-removal than control plots, whereas resident removal had less effect on light, similar to the garden experiment. Invasion mitigated a constellation of abiotic conditions associated with drought stress in the garden experiment. In the field, where other factors co-varied, these patterns did not emerge. Still, neither experiment suggested that drought and invasion will have synergistic negative effects on ecosystems, although invasion can limit light availability. Coupling factorial garden experiments with field experiments across environmental gradients will be effective for predicting how multiple stressors interact in natural systems.",9,0,9,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,10,"Carmen","Yes"

A synthesis of manipulation experiments","As a key component of the carbon cycle, soil CO2 efflux (SCE) is being increasingly studied to improve our mechanistic understanding of this important carbon flux. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change often depends on extrapolation of current relationships between ecosystem processes and their climatic drivers to conditions not yet experienced by the ecosystem. This raises the question of to what extent these relationships remain unaltered beyond the current climatic window for which observations are available to constrain the relationships. Here, we evaluate whether current responses of SCE to fluctuations in soil temperature and soil water content can be used to predict SCE under altered rainfall patterns. Of the 58 experiments for which we gathered SCE data, 20 were discarded because either too few data were available or inconsistencies precluded their incorporation in the analyses. The 38 remaining experiments were used to test the hypothesis that a model parameterized with data from the control plots (using soil temperature and water content as predictor variables) could adequately predict SCE measured in the manipulated treatment. Only for 7 of these 38 experiments was this hypothesis rejected. Importantly, these were the experiments with the most reliable data sets, i.e., those providing high-frequency measurements of SCE. Regression tree analysis demonstrated that our hypothesis could be rejected only for experiments with measurement intervals of less than 11 days, and was not rejected for any of the 24 experiments with larger measurement intervals. This highlights the importance of high-frequency measurements when studying effects of altered precipitation on SCE, probably because infrequent measurement schemes have insufficient capacity to detect shifts in the climate dependencies of SCE. Hence, the most justified answer to the question of whether current moisture responses of SCE can be extrapolated to predict SCE under altered precipitation regimes is 'no' - as based on the most reliable data sets available. We strongly recommend that future experiments focus more strongly on establishing response functions across a broader range of precipitation regimes and soil moisture conditions. Such experiments should make accurate measurements of water availability, should conduct high-frequency SCE measurements, and should consider both instantaneous responses and the potential legacy effects of climate extremes. This is important, because with the novel approach presented here, we demonstrated that, at least for some ecosystems, current moisture responses could not be extrapolated to predict SCE under altered rainfall conditions.",8,1,9,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,10,"Carmen","No"

A study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of the physiological state of Holstein-Friesian heifers on their enteric CH4 emissions while grazing a perennial ryegrass sward. Two experiments were conducted: Experiment 1 ran from May 2011 for 11 weeks and Experiment 2 ran from August 2011 for 10 weeks. In each experiment, Holstein-Friesian heifers were divided into three treatment groups (12 animals/group) consisting of calves, yearling heifers, and in-calf heifers (average ages: 8.5, 14.5, and 20.5 months, respectively). Methane emissions were estimated for each animal in the final week of each experiment using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique. Dry matter (DM) intake was estimated using the calculated metabolizable energy (ME) requirement divided by the ME concentration in the grazed grass. As expected, live weight increased with increasing animal age (P < 0.001); however, there was no difference in live weight gain among the three groups in Experiment 1, although in Experiment 2, this variable decreased with increasing animal age (P < 0.001). In Experiment 1, yearling heifers had the highest CH4 emissions (g.d(-1)) and in-calf heifers produced more than calves (P < 0.001). When expressed as CH4 emissions per unit of live weight, DM intake, and gross energy (GE) intake, yearling heifers had higher emission rates than calves and in-calf heifers (P < 0.001). However, the effects on CH4 emissions were different in Experiment 2, in which CH4 emissions (g.d(-1)) increased linearly with increasing animal age (P < 0.001), although the difference between yearling and in-calf heifers was not significant. The CH4/live weight ratio was lower in in-calf heifers than in the other two groups (P < 0.001), while CH4 energy output as a proportion of GE intake was lower in calves than in yearling and in-calf heifers (P < 0.05). All data were then pooled and used to develop prediction equations for CH4 emissions. All relationships are significant (P < 0.001), with R-2 values ranging from 0.630 to 0.682. These models indicate that CH4 emissions could be increased by 0.252 g.d(-1) with an increase of 1 kg live weight or by 14.9 g.d(-1) with an increase of 1 kg.d(-1) of DM intake; or, the CH4 energy output could be increased by 0.046 MJ.d(-1) with an increase of 1 MJ.d(-1) of GE intake. These results provide an alternative approach for estimating CH4 emissions from grazing dairy heifers when actual CH4 emission data are not available. (C) 2017 THE AUTHORS.

Observational and experimental studies can provide insight into how plant community in desert and grassland ecosystems responds to precipitation changes, however, the studies combining both approaches are rare. Here, we reported the results of altered precipitation effects on desert-shrub community and steppe-grass community from both a natual precipitation gradient and an experiment manipulating precipitation in Inner Mongolia, northern China. We found that precipitation changes along the natural gradient could well explain species richness and aboveground plant biomass (AGB), inducing their positive relationships in shrub- or grass-dominated community. In the manipulative experiment, 40% and 60% increased precipitation increased species richness and Shannon's diversity in grass-dominated community, and 60% increased precipitation increased AGB in grass-dominated community, while 60% reduced precipitation decreased plant density and AGB in shrub and grass-dominated communities. Species richness, Shannon's diversity, plant density and AGB were positively related to increased precipitation in the manipulative experiment. The positive relationship between species richness and AGB in the grass-dominated community could be shaped by the manipulative precipitation gradient, but no significant relationship was found in the shrub-dominated community in the experiment. Our study highlights that species richness and AGB in desert and steppe community consistently respond to altered precipitation along the natural gradient and in experiment. Extreme drought or high precipitation-induced shifts of the composition and production of herbaceous plants in the shrub-dominated community can contribute to shape the positive associations of community structure and function with precipitation changes. The high vulnerability of grass-dominated community in response to precipitation extremes presents a great challenge to effectively manage steppe ecosystem in future repaid climate changes.

"6","10.1890/04-0922","Effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning: A consensus of current knowledge","Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.",7,1,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,2,6,"Anny","No"

We investigated the effects of hydrology on vegetation of tidal freshwater marshes along the Patuxent River in Maryland, USA with a two-year field experiment, a one-year greenhouse experiment, and a seed-bank experiment. In the field experiment, sections of marsh soil and vegetation (sods) were elevated 10 cm, lowered 10 cm, or placed level with the marsh surface to simulate different hydrologic regimes. In the greenhouse experiment, sods were raised 10 cin above water surface (nonflooded) or flooded by 10 cm of water in tanks continuously, and in two other treatments changed from nonflooded to flooded or vice-versa after the first 35 days. For the seed-bank experiment, soil samples were spread in a 1-cm-thick layer in pans subjected to flooding by 3.5-4 cin of water or nonflooded but moist conditions in the greenhouse, and emerging seedlings counted. We found that lowering marsh sods by 10 cm (i.e., wetter conditions) in the field reduced plant species richness by 26% compared to the sods placed level with the marsh surface, while raising sods by 10 cm (drier conditions) increased richness by 42%. Total stem length of a majority of the most common species, as well as for all species combined, was more than twice as great in raised sods as in lowered sods. We observed similar patterns in richness and total stem length in the greenhouse study, where continuously nonflooded sods had almost twice the richness and 55% greater total stein length as continuously flooded sods. Sods that were flooded initially and then shifted to nonflooded conditions had richness and total stein length similar to the continuously flooded sods, while sods that were nonflooded initially and then flooded had richness and total stem length intermediate to continuously nonflooded and continuously flooded sods. In the field and greenhouse studies, species that are annual or annnual/perennial were more inhibited by flooding than were perennials. In the seedbank experiment, flooding reduced the number of species emerging by 50% and total densities of emerging seedlings by 80% compared to nonflooded conditions. Taken together, the results of the field, greenhouse, and seed-bank studies indicate that 3-10 cm of flooding can significantly reduce seedling recruitment and growth in many plant species of tidal freshwater marshes and result in lower plant diversity. The greenhouse study further indicates that shallow flooding early in the growing season can reduce the abundance of certain species, primarily annuals, for the remainder of the growing season, resulting in a less diverse community. These findings suggest that hydrology is a dominant environmental variable controlling interannual variation in plant species composition of tidal freshwater marshes. Additionally, this study suggests that small increases in frequency and duration of inundation, which might occur due to watershed land-use changes, sea-level rise, or land subsidence, will reduce the diversity of these plant communities.",7,0,7,0,1,1,1,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,8,9,-1,NA,NA

As these conifers increase in dominance on sagebrush rangelands, understory vegetation declines and ecohydrologic function can shift from biotic (vegetation) controlled retention of soil resources to abiotic (runoff) driven loss of soil resources and long-term site degradation. Scientists, public land management agencies, and private land owners are challenged with selecting and predicting outcomes to treatment alternatives to improve ecological structure and function on these rangelands. This study is the first of a two-part study to evaluate effectiveness of prescribed fire to re-establish sagebrush steppe vegetation and improve ecohydrologic function on mid- to late-succession pinyon-and juniper-encroached sagebrush sites in the Great Basin. We used a suite of vegetation and soil measures, small-plot (0.5 m(2) ) rainfall simulations, and overland flow experiments (9 m(2) ) to quantify the effects of tree removal by prescribed fire on vegetation, soils, and rainsplash, sheetflow, and concentrated flow hydrologic and erosion processes at two woodlands 9-yr after burning. For untreated conditions, extensive bare interspace (87% bare ground) throughout the degraded intercanopy (69-88% bare ground) between trees at both sites promoted high runoff and sediment yield from combined rainsplash and sheetflow (similar to 45 mm, 59-381 g m(-2) ) and concentrated flow (371-501 L, 2343-3015 g) processes during high intensity rainfall simulation (102 mm h(-1) , 45 min) and overland flow experiments (15, 30, and 45 L min(-1) , 8 min each). Burning increased canopy cover of native perennial herbaceous vegetation by > 5-fold, on average, across both sites over nine growing seasons. Burning reduced low pre-fire sagebrush canopy cover ( < 1% to 14% average) at both sites and sagebrush recovery is expected to take > 30 yr. Enhanced herbaceous cover in interspaces post-fire reduced runoff and sediment yield from high intensity rainfall simulations by > 2-fold at both sites. Fire-induced increases in herbaceous canopy cover (from 34% to 62%) and litter ground cover (from 15% to 36%) reduced total runoff (from 501 L to 180 L) and sediment yield (from 2343 g to 115 g) from concentrated flow experiments in the intercanopy at one site. Sparser herbaceous vegetation (49% cover) and litter cover (8%) in the intercanopy at the other, more degraded site post-fire resulted in no significant reduction of total runoff (371 L to 266 L) and sediment yield (3015 g to 1982 g) for concentrated flow experiments. Areas underneath unburned shrub and tree canopies were well covered by vegetation and ground cover and generated limited runoff and sediment. Fire impacts on vegetation, ground cover, and runoff and sediment delivery from tree and shrub plots were highly variable. Burning litter covered areas underneath trees reduced perennial herbaceous vegetation and increased invasibility to the fire-prone annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.). Cheatgrass cover increased from < 1% prefire to 16-30%, on average, post-fire across the sites and was primarily restricted to areas around burned trees. High herbaceous cover (73%) under burned trees at the less degraded site resulted in similar low total runoff and sediment from concentrated flow experiments as prefire (136-228 L, 204-423 g). In contrast, fire-reduction of litter (from 79% to 49%) resulted in increased total runoff (from 103 L to 333 L) and sediment yield (from 619 g to 2170 g) from concentrated flow experiments in burned tree areas at the more degraded site. The experimental results demonstrate pinyon and juniper removal by prescribed fire can effectively re-establish a successional trajectory towards sagebrush steppe vegetation structure and thereby improve ecohydrologic function. Responses to burning at the more degraded site suggest results should be interpreted with caution however. Although burning substantially increased perennial grass cover and reduced fine-scale runoff and erosion at the more degraded site, poor sagebrush recovery, delayed litter recruitment, and persistent high concentrated flow erosion at that site suggest not all sites are good candidates for prescribed fire treatments. Furthermore, high levels of cheatgrass in burned tree areas (similar to 30% of area) at both sites increases wildfire risk, but cheatgrass is expected to decline over time in absence of fire. Our results in context with the literature suggest fire-surrogate tree-removal treatments (e.g., tree cutting or shredding) may be more appropriate on degraded sites with limited pre-treatment sagebrush and perennial herbaceous vegetation and that seeding may be necessary to improve post-fire establishment of sagebrush steppe vegetation structure and associated ecohydrologic function under these conditions. Lastly, vegetation, runoff, and erosion responses in this study are not directly applicable outside of the Great Basin, but similar responses in woodland studies from the southwestern US suggest potential application of results to woodlands in that region. The concept of re-establishing vegetation structure to improve ecohydrologic function is broadly applicable to sparsely vegetated lands around the World.",7,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,7,NA,NA

This was done by comparing these inorganic nutrients, in various combinations, with farmyard manure, the traditional source of fertility at that time. Although the questions the experiments were originally designed to answer have long been resolved, the experiments continue to give results of interest to agronomists, ecologists, soil scientists, plant pathologists, and others. The experiments show that grain yields can be sustained (and even increased) for almost 150 years in monocultures of wheat and barley given organic or inorganic fertilizer annually. They provide data on the long-term effects of inorganic fertilizers and organic manures on soil organic matter levels. These data have been used to test computer-based models for the turnover of organic matter in soil. Again, long-term N balances show that there are considerable inputs of N to the soil/plant system, amounting to some 30 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in unfertilized wheat and up to 65 kg ha-1 yr-1 in an arable soil reverting to woodland.

This study focuses on the effect of selective felling (thinning) at a managed forest site. Previous statistical analyses of eddy covariance data at the study site had found that disturbance from thinning resulted in no significant change to net ecosystem carbon uptake. In order to better understand the effect of thinning on carbon fluxes, we use the mathematical technique of four-dimensional variational data assimilation. Data assimilation provides a compelling alternative to more common statistical analyses of flux data as it allows for the combination of many different sources of data, with the physical constraints of a dynamical model, to find an improved estimate of the state of a system. We develop new observation operators to assimilate daytime and nighttime net ecosystem exchange observations with a daily time step model, increasing observations available by a factor of 4.25. Our results support previous analyses, with a predicted net ecosystem carbon uptake for the year 2015 of 426 116gCm(-2) for the unthinned forest and 420 78gCm(-2) for the thinned forest despite a model-predicted reduction in gross primary productivity of 337gCm(-2). We show that this is likely due to reduced ecosystem respiration postdisturbance compensating for a reduction in gross primary productivity. This supports the theory of an upper limit of forest net carbon uptake due to the magnitude of ecosystem respiration scaling with gross primary productivity. Plain Language Summary Forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, removing large amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere and thus helping to mitigate the effect of human-induced climate change. The response of forest ecosystem carbon dynamics to disturbance events (e.g., fire, felling, and insect outbreak) is not well understood. Many observations are currently made that give us insight into the processes occurring in forests; however, there are many processes that we cannot observe. Therefore, we must use mathematical models of forest carbon balance to better understand underlying behaviors; however, these models are often subject to large errors. In this study we use advanced mathematical techniques to combine information from both observations and model predictions of forest carbon balance, to improve current estimates and better understand the effect of disturbance from selective felling at a managed woodland. We find no significant change to the total forest carbon uptake after approximately 46% of trees are removed from the woodland. Our best modeled estimates suggest that this is due to photosynthesis being the main driver for ecosystem respiration, so that reducing the number of trees has reduced carbon uptake from photosynthesis but concurrently reduced respiration, meaning total carbon uptake is not significantly affected.",0,5,5,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,NA,NA

Extreme droughts could interfere in the positive feedbacks between grasses and soil water content, pushing grasslands across critical thresholds of productivity and leading them to collapse. If this happens, systems may show hysteresis and costly management interventions might be necessary to restore predrought productivity. Thus, neglecting critical transitions may lead to mismanagement of grasslands and to irreversible loss of ecosystem services. Rainfall manipulation experiments constitute a powerful approach to investigate the risk of such critical transitions. However, experiments performed to date have rarely applied extreme droughts and have used resilience indices that disregard the existence of hysteresis. Here, we suggest how to incorporate critical transitions when designing rainfall manipulation experiments on grasslands and when measuring their resilience to drought.

Drought and plant invasions are intensifying in ecosystems worldwide, including ecologically and economically important pine forests of the southeastern United States. These stressors can alter resource availability and plant competition outcomes, and may together exert additive, synergistic, or offsetting effects on native species, but such outcomes are difficult to predict. We used a factorial common garden experiment to determine how simulated drought, invasion by Imperata cylindrica (cogongrass), and their interaction affected seedling survival and performance (relative growth rates of height and diameter, and biomass) of two native pine species, Pinus elliottii var. densa (South Florida slash pine) and Pinus taeda (loblolly pine). In general, loblolly pine outperformed slash pine over the course of the experiment, but the directions and magnitudes of each species' responses to the treatments were similar, with the two stressors often exhibiting additive negative effects on pine seedling performance. For both species, invasion significantly suppressed seedling survival, drought reduced relative growth rates in height, and drought and invasion had an additive negative effect on diameter compared to ambient conditions with resident plant communities. The suppressive effects of drought on these primary pine species suggests that increasing drought in the region could scale up to affect forest stand dynamics. Furthermore, the experimental demonstration of cogongrass impacts on pine seedling survival and performance should further motivate land owners and property managers to remove this noxious invasive species. To predict the long-term outcome of drought and invasion on forest stands, and more broadly on vegetation dynamics in ecosystems affected by these global change agents, additional evaluations of their separate and interactive effects are needed. Nonetheless, these results experimentally demonstrate that stress from experimental drought combined with competition from an aggressive grass invader can significantly suppress seedlings of primary pine species of southeastern US forests.",5,0,5,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,NA,NA
"13","10.1111/1365-2435.13875","Functional diversity response to geographic and experimental precipitation gradients varies with plant community type","Precipitation is a primary determinant of plant community structure in drylands. However, the empirical evidence and predictions are lacking for how plant functional diversity in desert and steppe communities respond to altered precipitation regimes. We examined how precipitation changes along the natural and experimental gradients affect different components of functional diversity in desert-shrub and steppe-grass communities. We compared the associations of precipitation changes with community-weighted means (CWMs) of six traits, functional divergence (FDvar) of each single-trait and multi-trait functional richness (FRic) and dispersion (FDis) for shrub and grass communities along the natural and experimental gradients. We also disentangle the roles of species turnover and intraspecific variations in affecting the responses of different functional diversity to precipitation changes. We found that in general, the similar responses of functional traits or diversity to both the natural and experimental precipitation gradients were dependent on plant community type. Across both two gradients, precipitation was positively associated with CWM of plant height and negatively associated with the CWM of SLA and leaf thickness in grass community, while positively associated with FDvar of four traits and FDis in shrub communities. Both species turnover and intraspecific variations contributed to the responses of grass community traits to precipitation changes across both two gradients, and to FDvar of traits and FDis in shrub community along the natural gradient. In contrast, species turnover variations contributed to FDvar of traits and FDis in shrub community in experiment. These results suggest that there is better concordance between the effects of naturally and experimentally increased precipitation on functional diversity of plant communities, but different mechanisms behind the relationship of functional diversity-precipitation between shrub and grass communities. Grass communities can adapt to precipitation changes by average trait differences, while shrub communities persist through FDvar of single-trait and multi-trait dispersion, thus highlighting the important differences in adaptive strategies between shrub and grass communities. Our findings demonstrate that short-term responses of plant communities to manipulative precipitation changes can reflect long-term shifts at spatial scales depending on the specific functional trait and diversity.

"14","10.5194/acp-9-2619-2009","Estimating surface CO2 fluxes from space-borne CO2 dry air mole fraction observations using an ensemble Kalman Filter","We have developed an ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to estimate 8-day regional surface fluxes of CO2 from space-borne CO2 dry-air mole fraction observations (X-CO2) and evaluate the approach using a series of synthetic experiments, in preparation for data from the NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO). The 32-day duty cycle of OCO alternates every 16 days between nadir and glint measurements of backscattered solar radiation at short-wave infrared wavelengths. The EnKF uses an ensemble of states to represent the error covariances to estimate 8-day CO2 surface fluxes over 144 geographical regions. We use a 12 x 8-day lag window, recognising that X-CO2 measurements include surface flux information from prior time windows. The observation operator that relates surface CO2 fluxes to atmospheric distributions of X-CO2 includes: a) the GEOS-Chem transport model that relates surface fluxes to global 3-D distributions of CO2 concentrations, which are sampled at the time and location of OCO measurements that are cloud-free and have aerosol optical depths <0.3; and b) scene-dependent averaging kernels that relate the CO2 profiles to X-CO2, accounting for differences between nadir and glint measurements, and the associated scene-dependent observation errors. We show that OCO X-CO2 measurements significantly reduce the uncertainties of surface CO2 flux estimates. Glint measurements are generally better at constraining ocean CO2 flux estimates. Nadir X-CO2 measurements over the terrestrial tropics are sparse throughout the year because of either clouds or smoke. Glint measurements provide the most effective constraint for estimating tropical terrestrial CO2 fluxes by accurately sampling fresh continental outflow over neighbouring oceans. We also present results from sensitivity experiments that investigate how flux estimates change with 1) bias and unbiased errors, 2) alternative duty cycles, 3) measurement density and correlations, 4) the spatial resolution of estimated flux estimates, and 5) reducing the length of the lag window and the size of the ensemble. At the revision stage of this manuscript, the OCO instrument failed to reach its orbit after it was launched on 24 February 2009. The EnKF formulation presented here is also applicable to GOSAT measurements of CO2 and CH4.",2,3,5,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,"Lukas","No"
"15","no doi","The original USDA-ARS experimental watersheds in Texas and Ohio: Contributions from the past and visions for the future","The USDA Soil Conservation Service (USDA-SCS) realized the importance of understanding hydrologic processes on agricultural fields and watersheds in the mid-1930s. Based on this realization, the research program of the Hydrologic Division of SCS established three experimental watersheds across the U.S. to analyze the impact of landuse practices on soil erosion, flood events, water resources, and the agricultural economy. Two of the original watersheds remain in operation today within the USDA Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS): the Blacklands Experimental Watershed (now the Grassland, Soil and Water Research Laboratory) near Riesel, Texas, and the North Appalachian Experimental Watershed near Coshocton, Ohio. These original watersheds were designed for collection of hydrologic data on small watersheds and evaluation of hydrologic and soil loss response as influenced by various agricultural land management practices. A major contribution of these experimental watersheds is the quantification of soil loss reduction under conservation management, which has led to a drastic reduction in soil loss from cultivated agriculture in the 20th century. Riesel watershed studies produced the scientific basis for several watershed models that are now used worldwide to manage water quality and also facilitated fundamental analysis of the agronomic and environmental effects of tillage, fertilizer, and pesticide alternatives. Coshocton watershed studies led to the development of no-till and pasture management practices to control runoff, erosion, and chemical loss and were instrumental in understanding water quality and hydrologic effects of soil macropores and mining and reclamation activities. The long-term hydrologic records at each site have also improved understanding and management of water resources in their respective geographic regions. Because of their historical and future value, the USDA-ARS has a unique responsibility to maintain these long-term experimental watersheds, which are vital for addressing emerging research needs to meet future water availability, environmental quality, and food and fiber demands.",5,0,5,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,6,"Lau","No"
