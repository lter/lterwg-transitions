However, they are extremely vulnerable to natural factors, such as changes in river hydrological conditions (floods, droughts) and disturbances from human activities (dams, farmland encroachment, etc.). The distribution of plant life forms and variations in the degree of vegetation coverage in a riparian zone can reflect changes in the environmental conditions. In this study, we analyzed eight reaches from the four main tributaries (Dongyang River, Yang River, Sanggan River, and Yongding River) of the Yongding River Basin, which were selected based on their climate, terrain, and degree of human disturbance. One reach was located on the Dongyang River (DYR), two reaches on the Yang River (YR1 and YR2), three on the Sanggan River (SGR1, 2, and 3), and two on the Yongding River (YDR1 and YDR2). Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology was used to obtain high-resolution, true-color, multispectral images. The distributions of the plant life forms and the differences in the vegetation coverage were analyzed in the eight selected riparian zones. The results showed that grasses dominated the riparian zone and shrubs and trees were sparsely distributed along both banks of all streams, excluding SGR2 and YDR1. The areas with an extremely high vegetation coverage classification accounted for the highest proportion in the DYR (29.3%), YR2 (48.1%), SGR1 (32.9%), SGR2 (39.9%), SGR3 (85.1%), YDR1 (36.7%), and YDR2 (51.1%) reaches. Extremely low vegetation coverage accounted for the highest proportion in the YR2 reach, reaching 37.4%. This study indicated that natural factors and human activities have a serious impact on the distribution of different plants life forms and vegetation coverage classifications in the riparian zones of the Yongding River Basin. We hope that this research can provide practical assistance in the efforts of ecological restoration and the management of riparian vegetation in the Yongding River Basin.",0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,15,-15,NA,NA

While attention has been given to the responses of aquatic invertebrates to drying rivers, few studies exist on the terrestrial invertebrates colonizing dry river beds. Dry river beds are physically harsh and they often differ substantially in substrate, topography, microclimate and inundation frequency from adjacent riparian zones. Given these differences, we predicted that dry river beds provide a unique habitat for terrestrial invertebrates, and that their assemblage composition differs from that in adjacent riparian zones. Dry river beds and riparian zones in Australia and Italy were sampled for terrestrial invertebrates with pitfall traps. Sites differed in substrate type, climate and flow regime. Dry river beds contained diverse invertebrate assemblages and their composition was consistently different from adjacent riparian zones, irrespective of substrate, climate or hydrology. Although some taxa were shared between dry river beds and riparian zones, 66 of 320 taxa occurred only in dry river beds. Differences were due to species turnover, rather than shifts in abundance, indicating that dry river bed assemblages are not simply subsets of riparian assemblages. Some spatial patterns in invertebrate assemblages were associated with environmental variables (irrespective of habitat type), but these associations were statistically weak. We suggest that dry river beds are unique habitats in their own right. We discuss potential human stressors and management issues regarding dry river beds and provide recommendations for future research.",0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,14,-14,NA,NA

However, climatic change scenarios and anthropogenic interventions are expected to shift from perennial to intermittent rivers with possible repercussion on aquatic biodiversity and human well-being. Our study identified a significant reduction in the Mediterranean intermittent river streamflow with an increase of zero flow days in the last decades. Furthermore, the aquatic invertebrates showed variations during the transition from drying to rewetting with a significantly changing species adapted to the flowing conditions (rheophilic taxa) to non-flowing water. The importance of the disconnected pools as refuges during the dry condition was recognised to protect some endemic species and contribute to the recolonisation after the rewetting events. Include these important aquatic ecosystems in management and conservancy policies is a challenge that will contribute to preserving the freshwater resources and the biological diversity for our future generations. Intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) are increasingly studied because of their often-unique aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity, biogeochemical processes and associated ecosystem services. This study is the first to examine the hydrological, physicochemical and taxonomic variability during the dry-wet transition of an intermittent river in the Chilean Mediterranean Zone. Based on 30-years of river monitoring data and the TREHS tool, the hydrology of the river was characterised. Overall, the river shows a significant reduction in streamflow (-0.031 m(3)/s per year) and a substantial increase of zero flow days (+3.5 days per year). During the transition of hydrological states, variations were observed in the environmental conditions and invertebrate communities. During the drying phase, abundance, richness, and diversity were highest, while species turn-over was highest during base flow conditions. The disconnected pools and the flow resumption phases were characterised by high proportions of lentic taxa and non-insects, such as the endemic species of bivalves, gastropods, and crustaceans, highlighting the relevance of disconnected pools as refuges. Future climatic change scenarios are expected to impact further the hydrology of IRES, which could result in the loss of biodiversity.

However, the role of herbivory in driving recovery across environmental gradients is often unclear. Here we investigate early successional benthic communities and coral recruitment across a sediment gradient in Palau, Micronesia over a 12-month period. Total sedimentation rates measured by 'TurfPods' varied from 0.03 +/- 0.1 SE mg cm(-2) d(-1) at offshore sites to 1.32 +/- 0.2 mg cm(-2) d(-1) at inshore sites. To assess benthic succession, three-dimensional settlement tiles were deployed at sites with experimental cages used to exclude tile access to larger herbivorous fish. Benthic assemblages exhibited rapid transitions across the sediment gradient within three months of deployment. At low levels of sedimentation (less than 0.6 mg cm(-2) d(-1)), herbivory resulted in communities dominated by coral recruitment inducers (short turf algae and crustose coralline algae), whereas exclusion of herbivores resulted in the overgrowth of coral inhibitors (encrusting and upright foliose macroalgae). An 'inducer threshold' was found under increasing levels of sedimentation (greater than 0.6 mg cm(-2) d(-1)), with coral inducers having limited to no presence in communities, and herbivore access to tiles resulted in sediment-laden turf algal assemblages, while exclusion of herbivores resulted in invertebrates (sponges, ascidians) and terrestrial sediment accumulation. A 'coral recruitment threshold' was found at 0.8 mg cm(-2) d(-1), below which net coral recruitment was reduced by 50% in the absence of herbivores, while recruitment was minimal above the threshold. Our results highlight nonlinear trajectories of benthic succession across sediment gradients and identify strong interactions between sediment and herbivory that have cascading effects on coral recruitment. Local management strategies that aim to reduce sedimentation and turbidity and manage herbivore fisheries can have measurable effects on benthic community succession and coral recruitment, enhancing reef resilience and driving coral recovery.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,13,-12,NA,NA

Yet, landscape-scale studies of major coastal rivers from the river mouth to the head of tide, such as this study, remain rare. Here, we develop a new predictive framework for estuarine-tidal river research and management using a river-specific low-water datum and the wetland inundation indicator SEVg, the growing-season sum exceedance value of hourly surface-water depth. The distribution and variability of the wetland species pool (n = 203) on the 234 river kilometer (rkm) lower Columbia River and estuary floodplain are described for the first time. 4,940 quadrats at 50 marshes were surveyed (2005-2016). Throughout the estuarine-tidal river system, SEV(g)was well suited to describe the wetland inundation regime and its variability based on the combination of longitudinal river position and elevation. SEV(g)increased significantly landward. Two primary wetland inundation regimes were identified: the seaward-tidal, usually greatest during the winter months, and landward-fluvial, greatest during the growing season. Nearest the ocean, salinity is the abiotic factor limiting species richness and non-native species. Farther upriver, the daily, seasonal, and interannual variability of the wetting and drying cycle encourage disturbance-tolerant species and non-natives and limit the number of hydrophytes and total vegetative cover. Hence, the average between-year similarity of site-scale areal cover significantly decreased landward. Hierarchical cluster analysis indicated five vegetative groups and five ecohydrologic zones between rkm 0 and 234 were discriminated with 76 significant species-zone associations. All zones had unique indicator species. Species with high indicator values wereCarex lyngbyeithroughout the estuarine zones, andEleocharis palustris, Sagittaria latifolia, and the invasive non-nativePhalaris arundinaceain the upper estuarine and lower, middle, and upper tidal river zones (IV > 0.90).

"6","10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.02.018","Marine tetrapod macroevolution: Physical and biological drivers on 250 Ma of invasions and evolution in ocean ecosystems","The dominant consumers in today's ocean ecosystems are marine mammals, including cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, and other marine carnivorans. The ecological dominance of marine mammals can be traced back to at least seven independent transitions during the Cenozoic, when different lineages of terrestrial mammals underwent land to sea evolutionary transformations. However, the evolution of marine mammals represents only the most recent set of marine invasions by tetrapods over the past 250 Ma. During the Mesozoic, over a dozen different reptile lineages (e.g., mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, turtles, snakes) evolved obligate marine lineages, including a few lineages that persist to today, such as sea turtles. Birds, which are phylogenetically nested among diapsid reptiles, have also repeatedly adapted to marine life since the Cretaceous. Attempts to understand the common patterns of marine tetrapod evolution, and the processes that have shaped them, have largely been limited to individual groups. Placed in a broad comparative view from the Mesozoic to the Cenozoic eras, the macroevolution of marine tetrapods reveals evolutionary drivers at different scales, along with morphological parallels, unique evolutionary innovations, and the strong influence of historical constraints. Major physical, environmental drivers appear to be responsible for some patterns in marine tetrapod evolution at some temporal and geographic scales, but these drivers are not unique causes, as biological drivers (e.g., escalation) likely also play a role. The culmination of this trophic ascendancy has been dramatically altered by human hunting (especially of marine mammals), underscoring the need for historical datasets that extend into deep time to understand the ecological history of marine tetrapods.

"7","10.1186/s12862-019-1492-2","Evolutionary patterns of diadromy in fishes: more than a transitional state between marine and freshwater","Background Across the tree of life there are numerous evolutionary transitions between different habitats (i.e., aquatic and terrestrial or marine and freshwater). Many of these dramatic evolutionary shifts parallel developmental shifts that require physiological, anatomical and behavioral changes for survival and reproduction. Diadromy (scheduled movement between marine and freshwater) has been characterized as a behavior that acts as an evolutionary intermediate state between marine and freshwater environments, implying that diadromous lineages are evolutionarily transient. This hypothesis comes with assumptions regarding the rates of evolutionary transitions in and out of diadromy as well as rates of speciation and extinction in diadromous fishes. Results Based on a published phylogeny of 7822 species of ray-finned fishes, state speciation and extinction models of evolutionary transition between marine, freshwater, and diadromous species suggest transition rates out of diadromy are 5-100 times higher that transition between marine and freshwater or into diadromy. Additionally, high speciation and low extinction rates separate diadromous fishes from marine and freshwater species. As a result, net diversification (net diversification = speciation - extinction) is about 7-40 times higher in diadromous fishes compared to freshwater and marine respectively. Together the transition, speciation, and extinction rates suggest diadromy is the least stable of the three states. Conclusion Evolutionary transitions to diadromy are rare in fishes. However, once established, diversification rates in diadromous lineages are high compared to both marine and freshwater species. Diadromous lineages tend to be more transient than marine or freshwater lineages and are found to give rise to marine and freshwater specialists in addition to diadromous descendants. Although diadromy is not a necessary evolutionary intermediate between marine and freshwater, these results support the interpretation of diadromy as an important, occasionally intermediate state, that contributes to biodiversity in fishes in all environments. This evolutionary instability of diadromous lineages is counteracted by their relatively high diversification rates. These findings highlight the importance of integrating the dynamics of diversification and major evolutionary transitions for understanding macroevolutionary patterns.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,11,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,13,-13,NA,NA

Yet today, the importance of Si for plant functioning is slowly becoming better understood. Si is a crucial element for many terrestrial plant species (especially grasses), yet a recent surge of research has shown that some species of aquatic plants contain significant amounts of Si too. We argue that degree of Si accumulation is a functional trait in aquatic vegetation, with plants adapting to environmental conditions. Aquatic vegetation can show apparent plasticity regarding Si uptake, adaptive to water and wind dynamics, light interception, herbivory and nutrient stress. Beyond a plant physiological viewpoint, high Si uptake results in high BSi in plant litter, which can impact on aquatic decomposition processes. Si content in aquatic vegetation shows intriguing relations with other strength components such as cellulose and lignin. Si content has also been linked to fungal and microbial community, litter stoichiometry and invertebrate shredders: all factors that potentially influence organic turnover in aquatic sediments. Uptake of Si by aquatic vegetation is thus not only an important transient sink for Si in the global biogeochemical Si cycle, it can also affect carbon turnover in aquatic ecosystems. Experimental and field studies should be conducted to elucidate controls on aquatic plant Si uptake, especially focusing on interactive effects of multiple biotic and abiotic factors.

"9","10.1017/pab.2017.37","Land to sea transitions in vertebrates: the dynamics of colonization","Vertebrates with terrestrial or freshwater ancestors colonized the sea from the Early Triassic onward and became competitively dominant members of many marine ecosystems throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. The circumstances that led to initial marine colonization have, however, received little attention. One hypothesis is that mass extinction associated with ecosystem collapse provided opportunities for clades of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals to enter marine environments. Another is that competitive pressures in donor ecosystems on land and in freshwater, coupled with abundant food in nearshore marine habitats, favored marine colonization. Here we test these hypotheses by compiling all known secondarily marine amniote clades and their times of colonization. Marine amniotes are defined as animals whose diet consists primarily of marine organisms and whose locomotion includes swimming, diving, or wading in salt water. We compared the number of clades entering during recovery phases from mass extinctions with the rate of entry of clades during nonrecovery intervals of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. We conservatively identify 69 marine colonizations by amniotes. The only recovery interval for which prior mass extinction could have been a trigger for marine entry is the Early Triassic, when four clades colonized the sea over 7 Myr, significantly above the rates at which clades entered during other intervals. High nearshore productivity was a greater enticement to colonization than was a low diversity of potential marine competitors or predators in nearshore environments of a highly competitive terrestrial or freshwater donor biota. Rates of marine entry increased during the Cenozoic, in part because of rising productivity and in part thanks to the participation of warm-blooded birds and mammals, which broadened the range of thermal environments in which initial colonization of the sea became possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,-12,NA,NA

The data include two major Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events and the N2O decrease during global cooling at the Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a-4 transition. The N2O increase associated with D-O 19 (similar to 73-71.5 ka) was driven by equal contributions from marine and terrestrial emissions. The N2O decrease during the transition into MIS 4 (similar to 71.5-67.5 ka) was caused by gradual reductions of similar magnitude in both marine and terrestrial sources. A 50 ppb increase in N2O concentration at the end of MIS 4 was caused by gradual increases in marine and terrestrial emissions between similar to 64 and 61 ka, followed by an abrupt increase in marine emissions at the onset of D-O 16/17 (59.5 ka). This suggests that the importance of marine versus terrestrial emissions in controlling millennial-scale N2O fluctuations varied in time. Plain Language Summary Nitrous oxide is a powerful greenhouse gas that is produced naturally in soils and oceans. An important unresolved question is the extent to which anthropogenic warming will stimulate additional emissions from these sources, further adding to the warming. Past variations in the abundance of nitrous oxide have been observed using ice core reconstructions, but the reasons for the variations are not well understood. Nitrous oxide produced in soils is isotopically distinct from nitrous oxide produced in oceans. New measurements of the isotopes of atmospheric nitrous oxide provide constraints on how marine and terrestrial sources must have changed, driving fluctuations in nitrous oxide concentration during two intervals of rapid warming and a prolonged period of global cooling.

This study investigates the character and extent of bank instability along the Torrumbarry Weir Pool. Over 90% of the bank length in this weir pool was assessed as being actively eroding. Notch development was the dominant instability mechanism and it promoted other forms of bank instability. Erosion notches result from stable water levels and inherent soil instability of the river banks along the weir pool.

At the same time they are among the world's most threatened ecosystems because of the pervasiveness of dams, levees and other factors such as rapid spreading of non-native species. Hence, floodplains are ideal systems to study ecological impacts of multiple stressors at the local, regional and catchment scale. 2. Concepts such as the subsidy-stress hypothesis and the stress-induced community tolerance concept have been formulated to study the effect of stressors on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as on their functional linkages. 3. Riverine floodplains are pulsed ecosystems with distinct flow, sediment, resource and thermal pulses - thereby creating distinct 'windows of ecological opportunity'. Human modifications that truncate or amplify theses pulses will have cascading effects on river-floodplain interactions by shifting the thresholds of connectivity, resilience or resistance - causing drastic regime shifts. 4. Most aquatic insects and pond-breeding amphibians have complex life cycles with aquatic and terrestrial stages. They are exposed to different stressors in their aquatic and terrestrial realm. Because most life history functions of aquatic insects are restricted to a short terrestrial period, we need to fully integrate the 'airscape' into the future management of river-floodplain ecosystems. 5. Riverine floodplains integrate and accumulate multiple stressors at the catchment level, as reflected by distinct catchment fingerprints. Based on the European Catchment Data Base we provide spatially explicit information on multiple stressors; a key prerequisite for setting priorities in conservation and management planning. 6.

Although improved management systems have yielded benefits in many regions, broad-scale declines continue and additional practical and effective solutions for reef conservation and management are urgently needed. Ecological interventions to assist or enhance ecosystem recovery are standard practice in many terrestrial management regimes, and they are now increasingly being implemented in the marine environment. Intervention activities in coral reef systems include the control of coral predators (e.g. crown-of-thorns starfish), substrate modification, the creation of artificial habitats and the cultivation, transplantation, and assisted recruitment of corals. On many coastal reefs, corals face competition and overgrowth by fleshy macroalgae whose abundance may be elevated due to acute disturbance events, chronic nutrient enrichment, and reduced herbivory. Active macroalgae removal has been proposed and trialed as a management tool to reduce competition between algae and corals and provide space for coral recruitment, in the hope of restoring the spatial dominance of habitat-forming corals. However, macroalgae removal has received little formal attention as a method of reef restoration.
